A test to learn the basic functionality of firebase using javascript, npm and express

*signin to get back into an already created account by checking credentials
*add the nav bar to all pages, (displaying profile when signed in, and logout when signed out) with exception for when ur on the profile page then it displays a signout chioce.
*ie: the home page would majorly change and current signup functions would move to a new page.
*format some of the res.send() to be res.render(file) so that it looks better
*google authentication
