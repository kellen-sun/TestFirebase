# TestFirebase
A test to learn the basic functionality of firebase using javascript, npm and express

To-Do:
*develop a way to check if an user is signed in, show the home page differently if signed in or not signed in. as well as profile page links, signup/login functions and so on
*would need a signout function
*ie: the home page would majorly change and current signup functions would move to a new page.
*format some of the res.send() to be res.render(file) so that it looks better
*google authentication


Notes:
Using login to mean the process of entering into an account either by sign in or by creating an account
Exits an account by signout
